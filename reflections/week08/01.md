## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

the Portfolio provides a place where your work is visible. It can show potential employers that you know what youre doing.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

a good Portfolio needs to show the quality of your work. it shouldnt just include every thing youve built cause alot of it is probably not the best quality.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

perhaps the hackathon or the capstone were working on now. these projects are by far the most complex projects ive been a part of. they also show my ability to work in a group.
