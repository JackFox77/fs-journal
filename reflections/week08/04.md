## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing: allows you to test each individual unit in isolation

Component Testing

End-To-End (E2E) Testing
allows the programmer to test the program how the user would actually use it

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

based on what ive done i would probably do unit testing, but end to end seems best on paper

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

perhaps i do not understand it but i would say Component testing, but im willing to bet thats because im missing something
