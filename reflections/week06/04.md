## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

nested routes allow to use more complex interfaces within the components. they allow the parent component to control the rendering of the child component.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

one reason i can think is when you have a component that needs to load after another component, you can nest it inside of the parent to ensure that it loads before the properties its needed for.
3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes you can, i think you would use them when you want to pass data between the parent and child such as a form or input.
