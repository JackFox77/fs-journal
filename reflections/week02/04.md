## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan can help ensure that the quality. If you just jump in without forming a plan or doing research, may end up jumping around and not using time efficiently.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

The first thing if im really stuck is to ask for help. Other than that bootstrap and mozilla dev have information on most of the things that i need to know about.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

The thing that i found most significant takeaway was that just because it works , doesn't mean its right. There have been times where I am working and i get something to work, but i don't necessarily know why it works. I might be able to get it to work but if i don't know why then i may be doing it the most efficient way and ill have a harder time fixing it.
