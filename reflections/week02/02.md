## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

There is a function declaration, where you use the function keyword followed by the name of the function (ie :function name(){} ). A function expression is a function that is not named and not hoisted(ie let name = function(){} ). An arrow function is very similar a function expression, just with shorter syntax ( ie package => package.lost == true).

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the names of the definitions in the function and arguments are simply the value of the definitions in the functions.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

a higher order function is a function that takes in or returns a function (function, function, function, is there enough functions yet?). An example of a higher order function is Array.prototype.filter.
