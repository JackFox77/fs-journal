## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

you can view html/css in the elements tab. These are useful because you don't have to actually change the files and you can adjust elements while you watch them. You can then copy it over to the files if you want to keep it.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Best way that i know of is using debugger tags and console logs.
