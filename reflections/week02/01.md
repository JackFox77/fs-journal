## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

scope is the where the variables are usable. if you try to use a function where it isn't scoped it will likely return with an error or as undefined.

2. What is Hoisting ?

when something is hoisted, it will move to the beginning before the code is executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Var is not used as much as it used to be. Let is used far more often due to the improvements it has over var. I would probably us let when the variable im using can be changed and const when they must stay the same. Const are variables that once declared cannot be redeclared or changed.
