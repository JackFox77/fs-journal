## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Using bold text to create hierarchy seems the most useful for me.
I've tried to emphasize titles and headers by just using larger text or different font. These on here own just look out of place, and font weight is simpler anyway.x

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

If by resources you mean websites and other places to help, then i would probably say w3schools and their templates are a great help. The codeworks website also has some pages on helping with design. Of course there are also sites like youtube where you can find guides and tutorials.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design is important because it can convey certain things such as professionalism to the viewer. If the viewer sees a website that was thrown together badly or is hard to navigate, they might be less inclined to trust the operator of the sight or to buy any sort of product that the site is offering.
