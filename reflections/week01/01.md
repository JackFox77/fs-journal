## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git serves to act as a source control of sorts. It helps ensure that there are no conflicts with the code, especially when working with multiple developers.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Different branches allow the developers to have a test branch away from the primary source so any new changes don't cause issues to the main path. This allow the developer to work on the code in isolation and iron out problems before adding it to the primary source.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is the program that keeps track of changes and history of the code. Github is the service where you can upload the Git history and reflections so that they can be acsessed by others.
