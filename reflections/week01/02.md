## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

From what i've seen and used, a Pseudo-class is a form of css that gives some interactivity on the website. I'm not 100% certain if this is the sole use of them but it is what ive used them for.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificty is what determines which rule is applied. If you have an object that has multiple tags added to it on the same level, the one further down the line will be applied.
You can add a general rule which makes all divs blue, but one has a class that makes it red, the one with a class will always be red. Unless of course there is something of higher specificity such as an id.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

An !important tag essential makes it so whatever it is attached to will override whatever other style tags are attached. It wont override any other !important tags though. If you need to use an important tag, than you should really just create differant classes so that the specificity isn't clashing.
