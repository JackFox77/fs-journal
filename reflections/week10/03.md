## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

The key difference between columns and rows is that a column arranges data vertically from top to bottom, while a row arranges data horizontally from left to right.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters
(
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age VARCHAR(120),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    id int,
)default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

drop table would delete the whole table, delete from removes a specific thing from the table
