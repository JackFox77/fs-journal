## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

timeboxing is a time management system that assigns a fixed amount of time for each task

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

strategies i would use are using a timer, making a todo list and actually enforcing the time boxes for each task even if some may not be completed

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

there have been times where i'm working on something and i get so focused on the task that i ended being late or missing other appointments i had made. if i had set a time limit for how long to work and used a timer i probably would have been able to make it to the appointments.
